# API0: The API Router That Actually Gets It

You know that moment when you're building an app and someone asks for a feature like "show me sales data for last quarter"? Your brain immediately thinks: *Right, I need the analytics API, probably the quarterly_sales endpoint, with some date parameters.*

But your app? It has no clue.

That's the problem API0 solves. It's the missing piece between human requests and your APIs.

## What API0 Actually Does

API0 is dead simple:

1. You upload your API specs (OpenAPI or any texts you have writtent by hand describing your apis)
2. Users make requests in plain English (or Chinese or Arabic or French ... any language)
3. API0 tells you which endpoint to call and what parameters to use, copy/paste the code from our dashboard
4. You make the call yourself

That's it. No magic. No taking over your system. Just smart routing.

Here's what it looks like:

```javascript
const api0 = require('api0-sdk');
const client = new api0.Client({ apiKey: 'your-key' });

// User says: "Get weather for Berlin"
const route = await client.routeIntent('Get weather for Berlin');

console.log(route.endpoint); // "get_current_weather"
console.log(route.params);   // { location: "Berlin" }

// Now YOU make the actual API call however you want
// The dashboard will give you the code base, we will only have to customize with your security requirements
```

See? API0 just figures out the "what" and "how". You handle the actual execution.

## Why Not Those Other Frameworks?

You've probably seen tools like OpenAI functions, or Functionary or llama-cpp-agent. They're powerful, but they want to do everything for you. That sounds nice until you realize:

**They want to run your API calls.** This means sharing credentials, exposing your system, and hoping nothing goes wrong. What happens when someone figures out how to trick the LLM into calling the wrong endpoint? Not fun.

**SSO becomes a nightmare.** Your app uses OAuth with Microsoft/Google/whatever? Good luck getting that working when the framework wants to make calls from some random server. You'll end up with hacky token-sharing setups that make security teams cry.

**Infrastructure gets heavy fast.** Need 24GB of VRAM just to route API calls? Come on.

## The SSO Problem (It's Real)

Here's a scenario: Your company app uses Azure AD. Users log in, get tokens, make API calls. All secure and compliant.

Then you add Functionary. Now it wants to make API calls from its server. But it doesn't have the user's token. So you either:
- Store tokens centrally (security nightmare)
- Use service accounts (breaks audit trails)
- Give up on user-level permissions

With API0? Your client-side code gets the routing info, then makes the call with the user's token. Just like before, but smarter.

## What Makes API0 Different

**It stays in its lane.** API0 doesn't execute anything. It's just really good at understanding "I want customer data for January" and translating that to `GET /customers?month=2025-01`.

**It works with your setup.** React app? Node.js backend? Python service? Doesn't matter. The SDK tells you what to call, you call it however you normally would.

**No infrastructure headaches.** Upload your APIs, install the SDK, done. No GPUs, no model serving, no complex config files.

## Real Talk: Why This Matters

Building apps is hard enough without fighting your tools. You want something that makes the hard parts easier without creating new problems.

API0 does one thing well: it bridges the gap between human requests and your APIs. It doesn't try to be your database, your authentication system, or your deployment pipeline.

Sometimes the best tool is the one that just works and gets out of your way.

## Give It a Try

Head to [api0.ai](https://app.api0.ai), upload a few endpoints, and see how it works. The SDK is straightforward, the docs are clear, and you'll know in 10 minutes if it fits your workflow.

No vendor lock-in, no architectural rewrites, no explaining to your security team why you need to share credentials with another service.

Just better API routing.
