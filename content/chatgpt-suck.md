# ChatGPT Will Never Execute a Banking Transaction

People imagine ChatGPT as some kind of universal executor. Ask it to send money, run code, manage applications—it'll figure it out, right?

Wrong.

ChatGPT is closer to a philosophical café than a banking terminal. It's brilliant for conversation, exploration, general culture. But when precision matters—when you need trust, not plausibility—it breaks down.

Why? Because large language models hallucinate. By design.

## The Hallucination Problem

LLMs generate plausible answers, not guaranteed truths. They're prediction machines optimized for coherence, not correctness.

That's fine for writing blog posts or explaining concepts. It's catastrophic for banking transactions.

Imagine: "Transfer $10,000 to account... probably this one? It looks right."

No. Absolutely not.

Any system built purely on transformers and text prediction will never safely "press the button." The stakes are too high. The margin for error is zero.

## But What If They Could Think?

Here's the shift: stop asking LLMs to *act*. Let them *think* instead.

What if we could add reasoning to existing systems—without hallucinations, without delegation? What if the application keeps control, but gains intelligence?

This is where **api0** comes in.

## A Bridge, Not an Executor

Api0 doesn't run on behalf of applications. It acts as a connector. A brain you can attach to software that already works.

The application stays in control. It decides what gets executed. Api0 adds reasoning and exploration—understanding intent, mapping requests to the right endpoints, routing intelligently.

Think of it like this:
- **ChatGPT**: "I'll wire the money for you!" (Terrifying)
- **Traditional API**: "Call POST /transfer with these exact parameters." (Rigid)
- **Api0**: "You want to transfer funds? Here's the verified endpoint, here are the required parameters, here's how to structure the call. Your application executes when ready." (Intelligent bridge)

## The Best of Both Worlds

ChatGPT will never wire money. Nor should it.

But systems like api0 let us bring reasoning to applications that don't hallucinate. We get intelligence without losing control. Exploration without execution risk.

The LLM understands intent. The application maintains authority.

That's the architecture that works.
