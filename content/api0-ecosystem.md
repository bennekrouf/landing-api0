# Welcome to the api0 Ecosystem

Most AI tools today focus on generating text. Api0 is different: it's about *execution*. We make it easy for your applications to understand sentences and map them directly to your own API endpoints.

Here's how the ecosystem works:

## 1. Import Your Endpoints, Your Way

From the dashboard, you can bring in your APIs however you like:

* Handwrite a quick list of endpoints → we understand it.
* Upload a full **OpenAPI specification** → we understand that too.
* Point us to a **GitHub repo** → we parse it.

Once imported, you can test right inside the dashboard. Just type a sentence and see how api0 matches it to your endpoint. Fine-tuning is easy: add synonym sentences to improve matching. And because everything is dynamic, you can add new synonyms even while your system is in production.

## 2. Manage Keys and Usage

From the same dashboard you can:

* Generate an API key for integration.
* Track usage in real time.
* Keep costs simple—we're priced close to calling ChatGPT or Claude APIs.

## 3. Learn, Integrate, Build

We publish blog articles showing how to integrate api0 into your app. Our team is here to help too. Whether you want to:

* Add a **chat section** to your existing app.
* Build a **new app** from scratch.
* Or simply call api0 from your backend code.

We show you the exact code you need.

## 4. Execution for Your Users

Once everything is set up, your users can run any of your app's features using natural language:

* Search.
* Save.
* Run workflows.

All through sentences, powered by api0.

## Not Another Chatbot

This isn't about giving your users another chatbot. It's about giving your app a **brain for execution**.

Your endpoints stay yours. Your control stays absolute. Api0 just adds the intelligence layer that maps human intent to the right API call.

The result? Users who can work at the speed of thought, without learning your interface.

That's the api0 ecosystem.
